# Collection extension for chromium based browser

Enhanced version of <https://github.com/mienaiyami/collections-chrome-extension>

It is recommended to use store version for auto updates (but version is only updated after around 10days of releasing).

<!-- If you want to try this extension, download `build.zip` from releases and unzip it, open extension option in your browser, enable developer mode, load unpacked and select extracted `/dist`. You can turn off developer mode now. -->

Microsoft Edge Store Link (works in all chromium browser) : <https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/collections/fpolmkmcokpklimmekilomdghljpmpcf>

> Microsoft Edge extension updates usually take over 7 days. So it is possible for important updates to longer to be delivered.

Chrome Store : <https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/collections/kcijpmmfajideceadmcihckmodaiehpm>

> I recommend using Chrome store to get benefits of online backup (will be implemented soon.)

Local (**NO AUTO UPDATES**) : download `build.zip` from releases and unzip it, open extension option in your browser, enable developer mode, load unpacked and select extracted `/dist`. You can turn off developer mode now.
