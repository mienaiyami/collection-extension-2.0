# Translation Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in helping translate the Collections browser extension! This guide will help you contribute translations to make the extension accessible to users worldwide.

## How Translations Work

The Collections extension uses the **react-i18next** library for internationalization. All translatable text is stored in JSON files located in the `src/i18n/locales/` directory.

## File Structure

```
src/i18n/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts           # i18n configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ locales/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en.json         # English (default)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es.json         # Spanish
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [language].json # Your translation
```

## Contributing a New Translation

### Step 1: Check if Your Language Exists

First, check if your language already exists in the `src/i18n/locales/` directory. Each language has a two-letter code (ISO 639-1):

- `en` - English
- `es` - Spanish  
- `fr` - French
- `de` - German
- `ja` - Japanese
- `zh-CN` - Chinese (Simplified)
- `pt` - Portuguese
- `ru` - Russian
- `ar` - Arabic
- `hi` - Hindi

### Step 2: Create Your Translation File

1. Copy the `en.json` file and rename it to your language code (e.g., `fr.json` for French)
2. Translate all the text values while keeping the keys unchanged
3. **Important**: Only translate the text values (right side), never the keys (left side)

Example:

```json
// ‚úÖ Correct
{
  "common": {
    "cancel": "Annuler",     // Translate this
    "delete": "Supprimer"    // Translate this
  }
}

// ‚ùå Wrong - Don't translate keys
{
  "commun": {               // Don't translate "common"
    "annuler": "Annuler",   // Don't translate "cancel"
    "delete": "Supprimer"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Handle Placeholders

Some translations contain placeholders like `{{count}}` or `{{error}}`. Keep these exactly as they are:

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "copiedItems": "Copied {{count}} items",      // English
    "copiedItems": "{{count}} √©l√©ments copi√©s"   // French - placeholder preserved
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Add Your Language to the System

If you are not comfortable with this, skip this and only update the `src/i18n/config.ts` file and mention details in the PR.

1. Open `src/i18n/config.ts`
2. Import your translation file:

   ```typescript
   import fr from './locales/fr.json';
   ```

3. Add it to the resources object:

   ```typescript
   const resources = {
     en: { translation: en },
     es: { translation: es },
     fr: { translation: fr }  // Add this line
   };
   ```

4. Open `src/features/settings/components/LanguageSetting.tsx`
5. Add your language to the languages array:

   ```typescript
   const languages: Language[] = [
     { code: 'en', name: 'English', nativeName: 'English' },
     { code: 'es', name: 'Spanish', nativeName: 'Espa√±ol' },
     { code: 'fr', name: 'French', nativeName: 'Fran√ßais' },  // Add this
   ];
   ```

## Translation Guidelines

### 1. Context Matters

- **App title**: Keep "Collections" as is, or use a culturally appropriate equivalent
- **Technical terms**: Some terms like "Google Drive", "URL", "JSON" should remain in English
- **UI elements**: Buttons, menus, and labels should be concise and clear

### 2. Tone and Style

- Use a friendly, helpful tone
- Be consistent with terminology throughout
- Consider your target audience (general computer users)

### 3. Text Length

- Keep translations roughly the same length as English to avoid UI layout issues
- If translation is much longer, consider abbreviations or shorter alternatives

### 4. Cultural Adaptation

- Use appropriate date/time formats for your locale
- Consider right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew) - mention this in your PR
